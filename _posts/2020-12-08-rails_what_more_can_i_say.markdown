Hands down not my best work. Hello, everyone back at it again. Another project, dun du duh. 
I was unprepared. Rather than doing my lab work as scheduled, I have been watching a lot of Youtube; about working as a Software Engineer, Engineer's who are full-time full-stack programmers, and others coding live. My data usage has skyrocketed, a BIG PROBLEM where I live. I have been spending a lot of time doing nothing. I recently got an email from Flatiron, the monthly or so school updates. The first line of code, I mean title, that catches my eye reads *Mindset Shift: Become Results Oriented*. Wow, I have just been put to shame and uplifted by a heading. I have never felt more determined to get to 2021. 2020 has been such an emotional rollercoaster that article titles are making me feel like I have a personality disorder. Please, I mean no offense to anyone who suffers from this disability. 

Back to the article. It quickly reminds me that I waste most of my time being ineffective in life and coding. I do spend a lot of time on my labs when I do them and projects, but I get nowhere. After three days of working hard and getting nothing completed, I turn to old reliable, Procrastination. We are the best of friends I secretly hate him sooooooo much. Don't tell him I said that, or I will put a Byebug between your eyes and look into your mind. Jkjkjkjk. Let's move on. 

Rails, I was not prepared. While I feel my mind expanding and taking in the information, my lack of consistency is irritating my instructor. And me too. However, what has impressed me about rails is how intuitive it is. It's like painting, painters are given the same colors and canvas, and the routes, techniques, and style they use to get a result are overwhelming. There are shortcuts for the shortcuts. Take a migration for instance. The puns are strong in this one. They can be applied in three different ways, to my current knowledge: 

```
rails db:migrate

rails g resource User username:string email:string password_digest:string

rails g migration add_column_to_routines product_id:integer
```

I know that several other things are going on with these lines of code, yet, my point stands. 

On another positive note, the number of syntax errors that I caught while working out my code made me so happy. When asking for assistance, my questions weren't just about adding or removing a comma or end quotation. My ability to read the error messages is on point too. Small wins equal self-care. 

Until next time. Cheers!
