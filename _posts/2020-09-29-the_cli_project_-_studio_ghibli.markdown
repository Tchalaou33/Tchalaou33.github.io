Upon strategizing how to tackle this assignment, I was unequivocally ready to conquer it. Finally, I could bring all the snippets of logic, the Labs, together into a cohesive and orderly manner. Seeing the big picture behind the bits and give them a reason. Well, I assumed incorrectly. I now have even more questions than before. What is that saying, "The more you learn, the less you know." So, what to do? First, let me explain my troubles.

### My Troubles

This process has exposed the weakness or holes in my foundational knowledge. By no means am I saying that the Bootcamp is not cohesive enough for non-computer science/coder individuals: rather, explicitly understand that the information, any would-be coder, should possess is an understanding of basic operational and what I call fact-checking test logic before any attempt at writing code. 

What is the Basic Operational information? In this instance, I am referring to coders' knowledge of their local environment. I have the added misfortune that my computer likes to play mind-games. Ungrateful cheeky ba$!^#. Be that as it may, not having any working knowledge of how to operate your local environment will be an undoing. I highly recommend utilizing the setup provided by Flatiron https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/wsl-setup, Windows, or https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/environment-mac-os-catalina-setup, for Mac. I caution you when using the bottomless pit called the internet can be a bit much. Do not tell my instructor that I said that! Let us reflect on what the honorable Bill Gates said, 'I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it', Ya Dig?

For my next trouble in walks, Pry. Somebody call Naomi Campbell she is dethroned. The Fact-Checker, of course. I had no idea how to use it. Now I do. It is possible to build code without using Pry. As coders' why would you? Pry was sent from heaven to allow coders to dig deep and remember who they are. I have a love-hate relationship with it. Are they not the best kind, said No ONE.

### All the Rest

 To summarize and to leave a little food for thought, I realized early on that coding is math, particularly word problems, my worst nightmare. The most time consuming, smacking my head, FOR THE LOVE OF G#$&@ part of this project was the CLI file. This file is the money maker where all the action happens. Insert a creepy eyebrow dance. In the end, I made it, not on my own, that would be too presumptuous of me, but I'm here. I want to give a special thanks, hug, and best happy dance to all that helped me in this process. 

Until next time.
