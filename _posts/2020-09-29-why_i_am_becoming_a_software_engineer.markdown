Hi, my name is Andrea Tchalaou, Drea, and I have decided to become a Software Engineer. Yes, another one. But real tea, 90% of us are all here for the same thing, financial stability or freedom. Naturally, one would assume that I am a gamer or someone who holds a degree in computer science. You know relatively tech-savvy. Well, you would be dead wrong. I distinctively remember declaring myself a purist in my college days. I won't say how long ago that has been I am a lady. I truly believed then I was destined never to deal with computers pass sending a few emails a day and a nauseating but short-lived course in graphic design during college. Well, look at me now! Lol, that's just a little inside joke that I now share with you. I hoped you enjoyed it. Warning, there shall be many more attempts at hummer, So Get Ready! 

I'm looking for a career change. Something that gives me a little more control over my life, financially and emotionally. Hopefully, a purpose. Not to sound to down-trodden, but these past few years, since college, have been reminiscent of scenes from the Inception Movie. Not to say that my life's choices were not of my own doing. Side eye. But with much reflection, thanks to Coronavirus and the six years at my main job, it is time now for a grandiose sink or swim moment. So, I have put on my big girl panties (buckle up buttercup) and jumped off the highest cliff I could find. 

Until next time.
